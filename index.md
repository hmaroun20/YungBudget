<p>Welcome to YungBudget. This may not be the best advice, but it's definitely the most honest. This website is a project I'm building from scratch. It's meant to help educate other young adults, like myself, navigate the greedy & corporate landscape of modern America. </p>

<p> This website will dive into the following topics in detail: <p>

<ul>
  <li>Short Term Cash Management</li>
  <li>Long Term Asset Management</li>
  <li>Day to Day Cents-Saving</li>
  <li>Money Philosophy</li>
</ul>
